# GraphQL::Connections

Cursor-based pagination to work with `ActiveRecord::Relation`s.

Implements [Relay specification](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm) for serving stable connections based on column values.
If objects are created or destroyed during pagination, the list of items wonâ€™t be disrupted.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "graphql-connections"
```

## Usage

You can use a stable connection wrapper on a specific field:

```ruby
field :messages, Types::Message.connection_type, null: false

def messages
  GraphQL::Connections::Stable.new(Message.all)
end
```

Or you can apply a stable connection to all Active Record relations returning by any field:

```ruby
class ApplicationSchema < GraphQL::Schema
  use GraphQL::Pagination::Connections

  connections.add(ActiveRecord::Relation, GraphQL::Connections::Stable)
end
```

**NOTE:** Don't use stable connections for relations whose ordering is too complicated for cursor generation. 

## Development
